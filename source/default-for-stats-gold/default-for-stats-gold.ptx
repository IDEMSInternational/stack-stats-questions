                    This is a PreText textbook mirroring the statics STACK question on our Moodle server.

                    This makes it possible to preview questions without having to create an account on our Moodle server.
                    STACK integration into PreText is experimental, and thus not all questions may work as they do in Moodle.

                This question collection is designed to test learning at three complementary levels.
                The Conceptual Understanding questions focus on building and checking understanding of methods.
                The Applied Comprehension questions ask students to interpret results, and connect them to real-world data contexts.
                Finally, the Technical Skill questions go deeper, exploring the reasoning behind the methods and ensuring students can carry out correct calculations and processes in context.
                Together, these levels provide a rounded assessment of both practical ability and critical thinking in working with data.
